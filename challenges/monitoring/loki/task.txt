🔍 The Missing Logs Mystery - Loki Challenge
=============================================

📖 SCENARIO
-----------
Welcome to TechCorp's E-Commerce Platform!

The ops team is drowning in logs scattered across multiple services:
- Python Flask API (customer service)
- Node.js Order Service (order processing)
- Python Worker (background jobs)

Each service logs differently, and when things break, nobody can figure out
what went wrong because logs are everywhere!

YOUR MISSION: Set up centralized logging with Grafana Loki and solve the
mystery of the failing orders.

🎯 CHALLENGE OBJECTIVES
-----------------------

Level 1: Basic Setup
□ Start all services: docker compose up -d
□ Ensure all services are running
□ Access Grafana at http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000 (admin/admin)
□ Verify Loki datasource is connected
□ View logs from all 3 services in Grafana
□ Generate test orders (see HINTS.md for commands if necessary)
□ Observe logs appearing in Grafana

Level 2: Log Investigation
□ Find which service is generating errors
□ Identify the pattern: what triggers the failures?
□ Correlate logs across services to trace a failed order
□ Answer: Why are orders failing?

Level 3: Advanced Queries
□ Create a query that shows only ERROR logs
□ Find logs from the last 5 minutes for the order-service
□ Count how many errors occurred in the last hour
□ Identify which customer IDs fail most often

Level 4: Root Cause Analysis
□ What is the exact error message?
□ Which service has the bug?
□ What percentage of requests fail?
□ How would you fix this in production?
