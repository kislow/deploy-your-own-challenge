===============================================
Go Application Containerization Challenge
=========================================

**Difficulty:** Beginner → Intermediate

---

### SCENARIO:

Your team has developed a lightweight Go web service using the **Gin** framework.
It works fine locally — but now they want to containerize it for deployment.

They’ve tried a few Dockerfiles, but none seem to work reliably.
Either dependencies are missing, the binary fails to execute, or port mappings don’t work.

**Your mission:** Build a working Docker image that runs the Go web service correctly and exposes it to the world!

---

### TASKS:

**[ ] Task 1: Understand the Application**

* Review the provided Go source code.
* The app listens on port **8080** and returns a JSON message from an environment variable `MESSAGE`.
* Test locally using:

  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

  Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) — you should see the message output.

---

**[ ] Task 2: Write a Dockerfile**

* Use a lightweight base image (e.g., `golang:1.22-alpine`).
* Copy all project files and dependencies.
* Run:

  ```bash
  go mod download
  go build -o go-application .
  ```
* Set `/app` as your working directory.
* Expose port **8080**.
* Run the binary as the container’s entrypoint.

---

**[ ] Task 3: Build and Run Your Container**

* Build the image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t go-app .
  ```
* Run the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -e MESSAGE="Hello from Docker!" -p 8080:8080 go-app
  ```
* Verify that [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) returns your message in JSON format.

---

**[ ] Task 4: Bonus – Production Readiness**

* Use a **multi-stage Docker build** to minimize image size.
* Add a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
* (Optional) Add a basic **health check** in the Dockerfile.

---

### REQUIREMENTS:

* Container must successfully build and run.
* Application must respond on **port 8080** with a JSON message.
* The environment variable `MESSAGE` must be configurable at runtime.
* Bonus: Keep the final image under **50MB**.

---

### DELIVERABLES:

1. Working `Dockerfile`.
2. Screenshot or command output showing successful build and run.
3. (Optional) `.dockerignore` and multi-stage build example.

---

🔥 **Good luck, Engineer!**
Prove that Go apps can be lightweight, fast, and Docker-ready — just like a pro.
