# ⚙️ Tiny Linux API Challenge

# ===============================================

**Difficulty:** Beginner → Intermediate
**Theme:** Linux debugging, systemd, firewalls, API troubleshooting

---

## 🧩 SCENARIO

A tiny Python API on your Linux VM has gone offline.
The service refuses to start, the port is closed, and external clients can’t reach it.

Your teammates insist it “was working yesterday,” but now all eyes are on you.

Your mission:
**Bring the tinyapi service back to life and make it reachable from the outside world.**

---

## 🛠️ TASKS

### **[ ] Task 1 — Investigate the Failure**

Check the service’s behaviour, logs, and startup issues.
Identify what’s actually preventing tinyapi from running.

---

### **[ ] Task 2 — Fix the systemd Service**

Review the Unit file and correct the script path, working directory, or execution command.
Make sure the service can start cleanly.

---

### **[ ] Task 3 — Correct File Permissions**

Ensure that the API script has the right ownership and permissions so systemd can execute it without errors.

---

### **[ ] Task 4 — Install Missing Dependencies**

Verify that all required modules/packages are installed so the Python API can actually run without import errors.

---

### **[ ] Task 5 — Ensure API Port is accessible**

Make sure incoming traffic on port **5000** is allowed.

---

### **[ ] Task 6 — Local Verification**

Confirm the API can be reached on the local machine.

---

### **[ ] Task 7 — External Verification**

Confirm the API can be reached via the server’s public IP from outside on the same port.

---

### **[ ] Bonus — Custom API Response**

Modify the API so it returns:

```
{"message": "Fixed by <your name>"}
```

---

## 🎯 GOAL

* tinyapi starts normally
* API works locally
* API is reachable externally
* Bonus custom message appears

---

## 🏁 SUCCESS CRITERIA

✔ Systemd service fixed
✔ File permissions corrected
✔ Dependencies installed
✔ Port 5000 open externally
✔ Local & remote access verified
✔ Bonus improvement delivered
