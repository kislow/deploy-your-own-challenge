===============================================
Curl Troubleshooting Challenge
===============================================

Difficulty: Intermediate

SCENARIO:
---------
Your system suddenly started behaving strangely when using `curl`.
Some requests fail, others hang, and others return unexpected results.

Your teammate insists it‚Äôs a network problem ‚Äî but something feels off.

Your mission: Investigate what‚Äôs happening, identify the root cause,
and restore `curl` to its normal behavior.

---

TASKS:
------

[ ] Task 1: Baseline Testing
    - Run a few curl commands against known endpoints:
        ```bash
        curl https://api.github.com
        curl https://example.com
        ```
    - Observe the output carefully.
    - Compare behavior before and after system restarts.

---

[ ] Task 2: System Investigation
    - Inspect your environment for unusual configurations or overrides:
        ```bash
        which curl
        type curl
        env | grep CURL
        ```
    - Look for recent file changes or new scripts in common binary paths.
    - Check system services and temporary directories.

---

[ ] Task 3: Root Cause Analysis
    - Trace what happens when you run `curl`.
    - Review logs or recent configuration changes.
    - Identify what‚Äôs interfering with curl‚Äôs normal behavior.

---

[ ] Task 4: Apply the Fix
    - Once the root cause is identified, revert or repair it.
    - Re-run:
        ```bash
        curl https://api.github.com
        curl https://example.com
        ```
      The command should now behave consistently.
    - Verify that curl responses are normal and repeatable.

---

[ ] Task 5: Optional Hard Mode
    - Document your reasoning and findings.
    - Suggest how to prevent this issue in the future.
    - Bonus: Write a small script or service that safely restores curl functionality automatically.

---

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- Identify the root cause of the curl malfunction.
- Restore correct and consistent curl behavior.
- Document your investigative process and reasoning.

---

DELIVERABLES:
-------------
1. Summary of findings and applied fix.
2. Verification output showing working curl responses.
3. (Optional) Preventive improvement suggestions.

---

üèÅ SUCCESS CRITERIA:
--------------------
‚úÖ curl behaves normally again
‚úÖ Root cause discovered and fixed
‚úÖ Investigation clearly documented

üî• Good luck, Engineer ‚Äî
this one tests your system awareness and investigative instincts.
